## Assessment Quality Assurance

### Rubric Reliability Check
**Use quarterly to ensure consistent and fair assessment**

#### Inter-Rater Reliability Protocol
1. **Select Sample Work**: Choose 3 anonymous student portfolios representing different achievement levels
2. **Independent Scoring**: Have 2-3 teachers score using rubrics without collaboration  
3. **Compare Results**: Calculate agreement percentage for each rubric category
4. **Discuss Discrepancies**: Identify areas where scoring differs significantly
5. **Refine Rubrics**: Adjust language and examples based on discussion
6. **Re-Test Reliability**: Repeat process until achieving 85%+ agreement

#### Student Understanding Verification
**Quarterly Student Rubric Feedback Survey**
- Do you understand what each rubric level means? (Yes/No/Somewhat)
- Do the rubrics help you improve your work? (Yes/No/Somewhat)
- Are the assessment criteria fair and clear? (Yes/No/Somewhat)
- What would make the rubrics more helpful for your learning?

### Bias and Equity Review
**Annual assessment system review for fairness and inclusion**

#### Cultural Responsiveness Check
- [ ] Do rubrics recognize diverse forms of creativity and expression?
- [ ] Are technical standards culturally neutral and accessible?
- [ ] Do assessment methods accommodate different learning styles?
- [ ] Are there multiple ways for students to demonstrate mastery?

#### Achievement Gap Analysis  
- [ ] Review grade distribution by demographic groups
- [ ] Identify students who may be underserved by current assessment approach
- [ ] Analyze effectiveness of accommodations and modifications
- [ ] Adjust assessment methods to better serve all learners
