**Key Teaching Points:**
- "Semantic HTML provides meaning, not just structure - screen readers and search engines understand purpose"
- "Consistent navigation across all pages creates professional user experience"
- "CSS classes with meaningful names make styling and maintenance easier"
- "JavaScript files loaded at the bottom improve page loading performance"

### We Do: Guided Practice (25 minutes)
**"Let's Build Navigation and Layout Together"**

#### Setup and Structure Creation (10 minutes)
**Collaborative Foundation Building:**

Students work alongside teacher to create their own multi-page structure:

**File Creation Session:**
1. Create main folder structure following demonstrated organization
2. Set up index.html with personalized content but same semantic structure
3. Create placeholder pages for About, Projects, Contact
4. Establish CSS file organization with global variables

**Personalization Guidance:**
- Students adapt hero section content to their own portfolio purpose
- Class suggests different skill areas based on individual student interests
- Navigation names can reflect personal branding choices
- Color schemes customized using CSS variables

#### Navigation System Implementation (15 minutes)
**Build Responsive Navigation Together:**

**HTML Navigation (Students Customize):**
```html
<nav class="main-navigation">
    <div class="nav-brand">
        <a href="index.html">[Student Name/Brand]</a>
    </div>
    <ul class="nav-menu" id="nav-menu">
        <li><a href="index.html">Home</a></li>
        <li><a href="about.html">About</a></li>
        <li><a href="projects.html">Projects</a></li>
        <li><a href="contact.html">Contact</a></li>
        <!-- Students can add custom sections -->
    </ul>
    <button class="nav-toggle" id="nav-toggle">
        <span></span>
        <span></span>
        <span></span>
    </button>
</nav>
```

**CSS Navigation Styling (Class Builds Together):**
```css
/* navigation.css */
.main-navigation {
    position: fixed;
    top: 0;
    width: 100%;
    background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.95);
    backdrop-filter: blur(10px);
    border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border-color);
    z-index: 1000;
    padding: 1rem 0;
}

.nav-content {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-between;
    align-items: center;
    max-width: 1200px;
    margin: 0 auto;
    padding: 0 20px;
}

.nav-brand a {
    font-size: 1.5rem;
    font-weight: 700;
    text-decoration: none;
    color: var(--primary-color);
}

.nav-menu {
    display: flex;
    list-style: none;
    gap: 2rem;
}

.nav-menu a {
    text-decoration: none;
    color: var(--text-color);
    font-weight: 500;
    transition: color 0.3s ease;
    position: relative;
}

.nav-menu a:hover,
.nav-menu a.nav-active {
    color: var(--primary-color);
}

.nav-menu a::after {
    content: '';
    position: absolute;
    bottom: -5px;
    left: 0;
    width: 0;
    height: 2px;
    background-color: var(--primary-color);
    transition: width 0.3s ease;
}

.nav-menu a:hover::after,
.nav-menu a.nav-active::after {
    width: 100%;
}

/* Mobile Navigation */
.nav-toggle {
    display: none;
    flex-direction: column;
    background: none;
    border: none;
    cursor: pointer;
    padding: 5px;
}

.nav-toggle span {
    width: 25px;
    height: 3px;
    background-color: var(--text-color);
    margin: 3px 0;
    transition: all 0.3s ease;
}

@media (max-width: 768px) {
    .nav-toggle {
        display: flex;
    }
    
    .nav-menu {
        position: fixed;
        top: 70px;
        right: -100%;
        width: 100%;
        height: calc(100vh - 70px);
        background-color: white;
        flex-direction: column;
        justify-content: start;
        align-items: center;
        padding-top: 50px;
        transition: right 0.3s ease;
        box-shadow: 0 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
    }
    
    .nav-menu.nav-active {
        right: 0;
    }
    
    .nav-menu li {
        margin: 1rem 0;
    }
}
```

**JavaScript Navigation Functionality (Students Help Build):**
```javascript
// navigation.js
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
    const navToggle = document.getElementById('nav-toggle');
    const navMenu = document.getElementById('nav-menu');
    
    // Mobile menu toggle
    navToggle.addEventListener('click', function() {
        navMenu.classList.toggle('nav-active');
        
        // Animate hamburger icon
        navToggle.classList.toggle('nav-toggle-active');
    });
    
    // Close mobile menu when clicking on a link
    const navLinks = document.querySelectorAll('.nav-menu a');
    navLinks.forEach(link => {
        link.addEventListener('click', () => {
            navMenu.classList.remove('nav-active');
            navToggle.classList.remove('nav-toggle-active');
        });
    });
    
    // Highlight current page in navigation
    const currentPage = window.location.pathname.split('/').pop() || 'index.html';
    navLinks.forEach(link => {
        if (link.getAttribute('href') === currentPage) {
            link.classList.add('nav-active');
        }
    });
});
```

**Teaching Strategies During We Do:**
- **Students choose personalization:** "What should your navigation brand name be?"
- **Explain responsive design:** "Why do we need different navigation for mobile devices?"
