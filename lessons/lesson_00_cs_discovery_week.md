# CS Discovery Week: Gamified Introduction to Computer Science
**AP Computer Science Principles | Pre-Unit Foundation Week**

## Week Overview
- **Duration:** Week 0 (Before Unit 1 begins)
- **Format:** 2 blocks (180 minutes total) of hands-on, gamified CS exploration
- **Purpose:** Build confidence, demystify programming, and create inclusive classroom culture
- **Outcome:** Every student leaves excited and ready to learn programming

## Discovery Week Philosophy

### **"Everyone Can Code" Foundation**
This week establishes that computer science is:
- **Creative problem-solving** - not memorizing syntax
- **Collaborative and social** - not isolated and antisocial  
- **Accessible to everyone** - regardless of background or prior experience
- **Immediately useful and fun** - not abstract and boring

### **Game-Based Learning Principles**
- **Low stakes experimentation** - safe to try and fail
- **Immediate feedback** - see results right away
- **Progressive challenges** - build confidence through success
- **Social collaboration** - learn together, celebrate together
- **Choice and agency** - multiple paths to success

## Day 1 (Block 1): "Human Algorithms and Logic Games" 
**Duration:** 90 minutes

### Learning Targets
Students will experience algorithmic thinking through physical activities and understand that programming is step-by-step problem solving.

### Session Structure (90 minutes)

#### Opening Energizer (15 minutes)
**"CS Myth Busters" Interactive Game**

**Setup:** Room with "TRUE" and "FALSE" signs on opposite walls

**Myth Statements (students move to TRUE or FALSE):**
1. "You need to be good at math to be good at programming" → **FALSE**
2. "Programming is mostly typing really fast" → **FALSE**  
3. "Computer scientists work alone most of the time" → **FALSE**
4. "You can learn programming even if you've never done it before" → **TRUE**
5. "Programming is creative and artistic" → **TRUE**

**After each statement:** Quick discussion about why, with real examples

**Key Message:** "Computer science is creative problem-solving that anyone can learn!"

#### Activity 1: Human Algorithm Challenge (25 minutes)
**"Get the Robot to Make a PB&J Sandwich"**

**Setup:**
- One student volunteer is the "robot" 
- One student volunteer is the "programmer"
- Rest of class is "debugging team"
- Materials: bread, peanut butter, jelly, knife, plate

**Rules:**
- Robot can ONLY do exactly what programmer says
- Robot follows instructions literally (hilariously)
- Debugging team can suggest improvements
- Goal: Successfully make sandwich through clear instructions

**Example Progression:**
1. Programmer: "Make a sandwich"
2. Robot: *stands still* "I don't know what 'make a sandwich' means"
3. Debugging team: "Be more specific!"
4. Programmer: "Put peanut butter on bread"
5. Robot: *puts entire jar on top of loaf*
6. Class: *laughs and suggests improvements*

**Debrief (5 minutes):**
- "What made instructions clear vs. confusing?"
- "How is this like giving instructions to a computer?"
- "What did the debugging team do that was helpful?"

#### Activity 2: Binary Number Magic Tricks (20 minutes)
**"Mind Reading with Math"**

**Magic Trick Setup:**
Students think of number 1-31. Teacher "reads their mind" using binary cards.

**Binary Cards Game:**
- 5 cards with numbers arranged in binary patterns
- Students say yes/no if their number appears on each card
- Teacher dramatically "calculates" their number
- Reveal the binary secret!

**Hands-On Binary Practice:**
- Students work in pairs with binary cards
- Take turns "mind reading" each other's numbers
- Discover the pattern and teach others

**Connection to Computing:**
"Everything in computers - your photos, music, games - is stored as patterns of 1s and 0s like this!"

#### Activity 3: Logic Puzzle Relay Race (25 minutes)
**"Computational Thinking Olympics"**

**Station 1: Pattern Recognition**
- Visual sequences students must complete
- Find the rule, predict next items
- Examples: shapes, colors, numbers

**Station 2: Decomposition Challenge**  
- Complex task broken into simple steps
- Example: "Plan a pizza party" → identify all subtasks
- Teams compete to find most complete breakdown

**Station 3: Algorithm Race**
- Teams write step-by-step instructions for simple tasks
- "Teach someone to tie their shoes" or "Direct someone from classroom to cafeteria"
- Other teams follow instructions exactly - funniest results win!

**Station 4: Debugging Detective**
- Intentionally wrong algorithms provided
- Teams find and fix the errors
- First to debug correctly wins the round

#### Wrap-Up Celebration (5 minutes)
**"Computer Science Discoveries"**

**Quick Share:**
- "One thing that surprised me about computer science today..."
- "One thing I'm excited to learn more about..."

**Preview Day 2:** "Tomorrow we'll use real programming languages, but it's the same problem-solving thinking you just practiced!"
