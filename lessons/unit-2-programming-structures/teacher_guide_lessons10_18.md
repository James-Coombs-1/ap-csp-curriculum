# Teacher Guide: Unit 2 Lessons 10-18
**Programming Structures & Computational Thinking | AP Computer Science Principles**

---

## Overview and Philosophy

### Unit 2 Teaching Approach
This unit transitions students from web development foundations to core programming concepts through a dual-track system. Every lesson teaches identical computational thinking skills but allows students to engage through their preferred creative medium.

### Key Teaching Principles
- **Concept Before Syntax:** Focus on computational thinking over language-specific details
- **Parallel Learning:** Both tracks cover identical concepts with different creative applications
- **Progressive Complexity:** Each lesson builds systematically on previous knowledge
- **Authentic Projects:** All programs solve real problems and connect to student interests

## Lesson-by-Lesson Teaching Guide

### Lesson 10: Unit 1 Reflection & Unit 2 Track Selection

#### **Pre-Lesson Preparation (30 minutes)**
- **Review Unit 1 Portfolios:** Identify students who struggled vs. excelled for targeted support
- **Prepare Demo Equipment:** Ensure Scratch web access and Godot installation files ready
- **Set Up Exploration Stations:** Two computer areas with different software ready
- **Print Materials:** Track selection forms and goal-setting templates

#### **Teaching Focus Points**

- **Eliminate Track Bias:** Present both tracks as equally valuable and professionally relevant
- **Connect to Interests:** Help students see how each track aligns with their personal goals
- **Build Excitement:** Focus on creative possibilities rather than technical challenges

#### **Common Student Concerns and Responses**
- *"Is visual programming less serious than text coding?"* → "Professional companies use visual programming extensively. The thinking is identical."
- *"Will game development be too hard?"* → "We'll build up gradually from simple concepts, just like in Unit 1."
- *"What if I choose wrong?"* → "Both tracks teach the same skills. Your choice reflects learning style, not ability."

#### **Assessment Notes**
- Look for thoughtful reasoning in track selection rather than "correct" choices
- Note students who seem uncertain for additional individual conferences
- Document learning preferences for future lesson planning
