# Lesson 21: Introduction to Visual Programming with Scratch
**AP Computer Science Principles | Unit 2: Programming Structures - Track A**

## Lesson Overview
- **Duration:** 90 minutes (A/B Block)
- **Week:** 11
- **Unit:** Programming Structures & Computational Thinking - Track A (Visual Programming)
- **Prerequisites:** Completed Unit 1 (Web Development), Track selection completed

## Learning Targets

### I am learning to...
1. **Understand** visual programming as an approach to creating algorithms without text-based syntax barriers
2. **Analyze** how Scratch programming blocks represent fundamental programming concepts like variables, loops, and conditionals
3. **Create** my first interactive Scratch program using sprites, events, and basic programming structures

### Success Criteria - I can...
1. **Navigate** the Scratch interface confidently and explain the purpose of sprites, stage, and blocks palette
2. **Build** a functional Scratch program with user interaction using event blocks and motion commands
3. **Connect** Scratch programming concepts to AP Computer Science Principles Big Ideas and real-world applications

## AP Big Ideas Connections

### Primary Focus
- **AAP-2.A:** Express an algorithm that uses sequencing without using a programming language
  - *Connection:* Scratch blocks represent algorithmic sequences visually before text-based coding
- **AAP-2.B:** Represent a step-by-step algorithmic process using sequential code statements
  - *Connection:* Scratch scripts demonstrate sequential execution of programming instructions
- **CRD-2.A:** Describe the purpose of a computing innovation
  - *Connection:* Interactive Scratch programs solve problems and provide entertainment

### Supporting Connections
- **AAP-1.A:** Represent a value with a variable
  - *Connection:* Scratch variables store and manipulate data visually
- **CRD-1.A:** Explain how computing innovations are improved through collaboration
  - *Connection:* Scratch community sharing and remixing demonstrates collaborative development

## Materials Needed

### Technology
- Computers with reliable internet access
- Modern web browsers for accessing scratch.mit.edu
- Scratch accounts for all students (using school email addresses)
- Projection system for live demonstration

### Resources
- Scratch interface guide handout
- Programming concepts vocabulary sheet
- Example Scratch projects for inspiration
- Troubleshooting reference for common issues

### Preparation
- Create teacher Scratch account and sample projects
- Test school network access to Scratch website
- Prepare gallery of inspiring student-appropriate Scratch projects
- Set up accounts or account creation process for students

## Why Track A? Visual Programming Benefits

### Pedagogical Advantages
**Removes Syntax Barriers:** Students focus on logic and problem-solving without worrying about spelling, punctuation, or syntax errors that can frustrate beginners in text-based programming.

**Immediate Visual Feedback:** Changes in code produce immediate visual results, making cause-and-effect relationships clear and debugging more intuitive.

**Supports Different Learning Styles:** Visual, kinesthetic, and logical learners all find entry points into programming concepts through Scratch's multimedia approach.

**Builds Confidence:** Success comes quickly, building students' confidence that they CAN program and think computationally.

### Connection to AP Goals
**Same Concepts, Different Expression:** Students learn identical programming concepts (variables, loops, conditionals, procedures) but express them visually rather than textually.

**Computational Thinking Focus:** Without
