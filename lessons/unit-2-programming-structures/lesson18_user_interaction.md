# Lesson 18: User Input and Interaction Design
**Duration:** 90 minutes (A/B Block) | **Week:** 9

## Learning Targets

### I am learning to...
1. **Design** intuitive user interfaces that make programs easy and enjoyable to use
2. **Implement** robust input validation and error handling to create reliable programs
3. **Apply** user experience principles to create programs that respond appropriately to diverse user needs

### Success Criteria - I can...
1. **Create** programs with multiple input methods that feel natural and responsive
2. **Build** validation systems that handle unexpected or incorrect user input gracefully
3. **Design** user interfaces that provide clear feedback and guidance for successful interaction

## AP Big Ideas Connections

### Primary Focus
- **CRD-2.F:** Design a program and its user interface
- **CRD-2.I:** For errors in an algorithm or program, explain the benefits of hand tracing, visualizing, and testing
- **AAP-4.A:** For determining the efficiency of an algorithm, use informal reasoning

### Supporting Connections
- **CRD-1.B:** Explain how a computing innovation's purpose influences its functionality
- **IOC-1.C:** Explain how the use of computing can raise legal and ethical concerns

## Materials Needed
- Computers with track-specific development environments
- User interface design examples from popular apps/websites
- Input validation scenarios and edge case examples
- User experience design principles reference guides
- Error handling templates and debugging strategies

## Lesson Structure (90 minutes)

### Opening: User Experience Everywhere (10 minutes)
**"What Makes Some Programs a Joy to Use and Others Frustrating?"**

#### User Experience Investigation (5 minutes)
**Class Discussion - Analyzing Familiar Interfaces:**

**Great User Experiences:**
Students identify apps/websites they love using:
- What makes them easy and enjoyable?
- How do they handle mistakes or confusion?
- What keeps users engaged and coming back?

**Frustrating User Experiences:**
Students share examples of confusing or annoying interfaces:
- What makes them difficult to use?
- How do they respond to user errors?
- What would make them better?

#### User Interface Design Principles (5 minutes)
**Teacher Explanation:**
- **Clarity:** Users should understand what to do immediately
- **Feedback:** Program should respond clearly to user actions
- **Forgiveness:** Mistakes should be easy to fix, not catastrophic
- **Consistency:** Similar actions should work similarly throughout
- **Accessibility:** Programs should work for users with different abilities and preferences

### I Do: Professional User Interface Design (25 minutes)
**Live Programming Demonstration of UX Principles**

*Students observe parallel track demonstrations*

#### Visual Programming Track: Interactive Survey System (25 minutes)

**Building User-Friendly Programs in Scratch:**

**Clear Input and Feedback Demo (8 minutes):**
```
Create variables [userName], [userAge], [validInput], [errorMessage]

Define custom block "get valid name":
  Set [validInput] to [false]
  Repeat until (validInput):
    Ask "Please enter your name (at least 2 letters):" and wait
    Set [userName] to (answer)
    
    If ((length of [userName]) > [1]) then
      If (not <[userName] = []>) then
        Set [validInput] to [true]
        Say (join "Welcome, " (join [userName] "!")) for 2 seconds
      Else
        Say "Please enter your actual name." for 2 seconds
    Else
      Say "Name must be at least 2 letters long." for 2 seconds

When flag clicked:
  get valid name :: custom
```

**Robust Age Validation Demo (8 minutes):**
```
Define custom block "get valid age":
  Set [validInput] to [false]
  Set [errorMessage] to []
  
  Repeat until (validInput):
    Ask "Please enter your age (must be a number between 1 and 120):" and wait
    Set [userAge] to (answer)
    
    If <([userAge] > [0]) and ([userAge] < [121])> then
      Set [validInput] to [true]
      Say (join "Got it! You're " (join [userAge] " years old.")) for 2 seconds
    Else
      If <not <(answer) = [userAge]>> then
        Set [errorMessage] to "Please enter a valid number."
      Else
        If ([userAge] < [1]) then
          Set [errorMessage] to "Age must be at least 1."
        Else
          Set [errorMessage] to "Age must be 120 or less."
      
      Say [errorMessage] for 3 seconds
      Say "Let's try again..." for 1 seconds

get valid age :: custom
```

**Multi-Modal Input Options Demo (9 minutes):**
```
Create variables [inputMethod], [selectedOption], [menuChoice]

Define custom block "choose input method":
  Say "How would you like to interact?" for 2 seconds
  Say "Press SPACE for typing, or click me for menus" for 3 seconds
  
  Set [inputMethod] to []
  Repeat until (not ([inputMethod] = [])):
    If <key [space] pressed?> then
      Set [inputMethod] to "typing"
      Say "Great! We'll use typing." for 2 seconds
    
    If <touching [mouse-pointer]?> then
      Set [inputMethod] to "clicking"
      Say "Perfect! We'll use click menus." for 2 seconds
      Wait until <not <touching [mouse-pointer]?>>

Define custom block "get preference with method" with input "question":
  If ([inputMethod] = "typing") then
    Ask [question] and wait
    Set [selectedOption] to (answer)
  Else
    Say [question] for 2 seconds
    Say "Click me for Option A, press any key for Option B" for 3 seconds
    
    Wait until <<touching [mouse-pointer]?> or <key [any] pressed?>>
    
    If <touching [mouse-pointer]?> then

### We Do: User-Centered Design Challenge (30 minutes)
**Collaborative Interface Development**

*Students work in pairs within their track*

#### Both Tracks: "Accessibility-First Program Design"
**Building programs that work well for diverse users**

**Planning Phase (5 minutes):**
Students identify different user needs and preferences:
- Users who prefer typing vs. clicking
- Users with different reading levels or language backgrounds
- Users with limited time vs. users who want detailed information
- Users who make mistakes vs. users who are very careful
- Users with different technology comfort levels

#### Visual Programming Track Implementation (25 minutes)

**Collaborative Building Process:**

**Step 1: Multiple Input Methods (8 minutes)**
```
Create variables [inputPreference], [userName], [userChoice]

Define custom block "detect input preference":
  Say "How do you prefer to interact with programs?" for 3 seconds
  Say "Press T for typing, C for clicking, or S for simple mode" for 4 seconds
  
  Wait until <<key [t] pressed?> or <key [c] pressed?> or <key [s] pressed?>>
  
  If <key [t] pressed?> then
    Set [inputPreference] to "typing"
    Say "Great! We'll use text input." for 2 seconds
  
  If <key [c] pressed?> then
    Set [inputPreference] to "clicking"
    Say "Perfect! We'll use click menus." for 2 seconds
  
  If <key [s] pressed?> then
    Set [inputPreference] to "simple"
    Say "Excellent! We'll keep things simple." for 2 seconds

Define custom block "get user info":
  If ([inputPreference] = "typing") then
    Ask "What's your name?" and wait
    Set [userName] to (answer)
  Else
    If ([inputPreference] = "clicking") then
      Say "Click me when ready to enter your name" for 3 seconds
      Wait until <touching [mouse-pointer]?>
      Ask "What's your name?" and wait
      Set [userName] to (answer)
    Else
      Set [userName] to "Friend"
      Say "Hi there, Friend!" for 2 seconds
```

**Step 2: Adaptive Complexity (8 minutes)**
```
Define custom block "present information" with input "complexity":
  If ([complexity] = "simple") then
    Say "Welcome! This program helps you learn." for 3 seconds
    Say "Press any key to continue." for 2 seconds
  Else
    If ([complexity] = "detailed") then
      Say "Welcome to our comprehensive learning system!" for 3 seconds
      Say "This program offers multiple ways to practice and learn new concepts." for 3 seconds
      Say "You can customize your experience and track your progress over time." for 3 seconds
    Else
      Say (join "Welcome, " (join [userName] "!")) for 2 seconds
      Say "This program adapts to how you like to learn." for 3 seconds

Define custom block "get complexity preference":
  If ([inputPreference] = "simple") then
    present information "simple" :: custom
  Else
    Ask "Would you like simple explanations or detailed information? (simple/detailed)" and wait
    If ((answer) contains "simple") then
      present information "simple" :: custom
    Else
      present information "detailed" :: custom
```

**Step 3: Error Prevention and Recovery (9 minutes)**
```
Create variables [attempts], [maxAttempts], [helpLevel], [validAnswer]

Define custom block "get safe input" with input "question":
  Set [attempts] to [0]
  Set [maxAttempts] to [3]
  Set [helpLevel] to [1]
  Set [validAnswer] to [false]
  
  Repeat until (([validAnswer] = [true]) or ([attempts] > [maxAttempts])):
    If ([helpLevel] = [1]) then
      Ask [question] and wait
    Else
      If ([helpLevel] = [2]) then
        Ask (join [question] " (Try a number between 1 and 10)") and wait
      Else
        Ask (join [question] " (Examples: 1, 5, or 10)") and wait
    
    Change [attempts] by (1)
    
    If <([answer] > [0]) and ([answer] < [11])> then
      Set [validAnswer] to [true]
      Say "Perfect! Thank you." for 2 seconds
    Else
      If ([attempts] < [maxAttempts]) then
        If ([helpLevel] = [1]) then
          Say "Hmm, that doesn't look right. Let me give you a hint!" for 3 seconds
        Else
          Say "Almost there! One more try with my help:" for 2 seconds
        
        Change [helpLevel] by (1)
      Else
        Say "No problem! Let's move on and come back to this later." for 3 seconds
        Set [validAnswer] to [true]  # Accept and move forward

When flag clicked:
  detect input preference :: custom
  get user info :: custom
  get complexity preference :: custom
  get safe input "What's your favorite number?" :: custom

### You Do: Personal Accessibility Project (20 minutes)
**Independent User Experience Design**

#### Individual Challenge: "Universal Design Champion"
**Create a program that works well for diverse users with different needs and preferences**

**Project Options:**
1. **Study Helper Tool:** Support different learning styles, reading levels, and time constraints
2. **Game Menu System:** Accommodate different input preferences, experience levels, and accessibility needs
3. **Information Collector:** Handle various response styles, error patterns, and user comfort levels
4. **Creative Expression Tool:** Support different creative processes, technical skills, and artistic goals

**Universal Design Requirements:**
- **Multiple Input Methods:** At least 2 different ways users can interact
- **Adaptive Complexity:** Program adjusts detail level based on user preference or performance
- **Error Recovery:** Graceful handling of mistakes with helpful guidance
- **Clear Feedback:** Users always know what's happening and what to do next
- **Accessibility Features:** At least 2 accommodations for different user needs

**User Experience Goals:**
- **Inclusive:** Works for users with different abilities and preferences
- **Forgiving:** Mistakes don't cause frustration or program failure
- **Adaptive:** Program learns from user behavior and adjusts accordingly
- **Clear:** Purpose and next steps are always obvious to users

**Self-Assessment Questions:**
1. How does my program accommodate different user preferences and abilities?
2. What happens when users make mistakes, and how does my program help them recover?
3. How does my program provide feedback that helps users understand what's happening?
4. What would make my program even more accessible and user-friendly?

### Wrap-Up: User Experience Reflection (5 minutes)
**"Great Design is Invisible - Bad Design is Frustrating"**

#### User Experience Principles Review (3 minutes)
**Quick Class Discussion:**
- "What's the most user-friendly feature you added to your program?"
- "How did thinking about different user needs change your design approach?"
- "What's one way you could make your Unit 1 portfolio more accessible?"
