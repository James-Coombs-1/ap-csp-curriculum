## üß† **Essential Concepts for the Exam**

### **Programming Concepts (Most Important!)**

#### **Variables and Data Types**
```
Variables store information:
- Numbers: age ‚Üê 16
- Text: name ‚Üê "Alex"  
- Boolean: isStudent ‚Üê true
- Lists: colors ‚Üê ["red", "blue", "green"]
```

**What you'll be tested on:**
- Understanding what variables store
- Tracing variable values through programs
- Data abstraction using lists

#### **Algorithms and Control Structures**
```
Sequencing: Steps happen in order
Selection: IF/ELSE statements make decisions
Iteration: REPEAT loops do things multiple times

Example:
REPEAT 5 TIMES
{
    IF (score > 90)
    {
        DISPLAY("Great job!")
    }
    ELSE
    {
        DISPLAY("Keep trying!")
    }
}
```

**What you'll be tested on:**
- Predicting program output
- Understanding flowcharts and pseudocode
- Comparing algorithm efficiency

#### **Procedures and Functions**
```
PROCEDURE drawSquare(size)
{
    REPEAT 4 TIMES
    {
        MOVE_FORWARD(size)
        ROTATE_RIGHT(90)
    }
}

Call the procedure: drawSquare(50)
```

**What you'll be tested on:**
- Understanding how procedures work with parameters
- Benefits of procedural abstraction
- How procedures manage complexity

### **Data and Information**

#### **Binary Numbers**
**You need to be able to:**
- Convert decimal to binary: 13 = 8 + 4 + 1 = 1101‚ÇÇ
- Convert binary to decimal: 1011‚ÇÇ = 8 + 2 + 1 = 11
- Understand that everything in computers is stored as 1s and 0s

**Quick Conversion Chart:**
```
Decimal | Binary
--------|--------
0       | 0000
1       | 0001
2       | 0010
3       | 0011
4       | 0100
5       | 0101
6       | 0110
7       | 0111
8       | 1000
```

#### **Data Compression**
- **Lossless:** Can recreate original exactly (like ZIP files)
- **Lossy:** Loses some information but much smaller (like JPEG images)
- **Trade-off:** File size vs. quality

### **Internet and Networks**

#### **How Data Travels**
1. **Packets:** Data broken into small pieces
2. **Routing:** Packets find path across network
3. **Protocols:** Rules for how communication works (HTTP, TCP, IP)
4. **Reassembly:** Packets put back together at destination

#### **Internet Properties**
- **Fault tolerant:** Still works if parts fail
- **Scalable:** Can grow to accommodate more users
- **Open:** Anyone can connect and create content

### **Computing Impact**

#### **Beneficial vs. Harmful Effects**
**Examples to know:**
- **Social Media:** Connects people globally BUT can spread misinformation
- **GPS:** Helps navigation BUT raises privacy concerns
- **AI:** Automates tasks BUT may eliminate jobs
- **Online Shopping:** Convenient BUT threatens local businesses

#### **Digital Divide**
- **Definition:** Gap between those who have access to technology and those who don't
- **Factors:** Income, location, age, education, disability
- **Impact:** Affects opportunities for education, jobs, civic participation
